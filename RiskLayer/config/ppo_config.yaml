# REWARD SETTINGS (v3 PROFIT-FOCUSED - Implemented in risk_env.py)
# =========================================================================
# NO BLOCKING - All trades execute
# 
# Profit Maximization:
#   - Profits: +R * 150.0  [Amplified reward]
#   - Losses:  -R * 200.0  [Stronger penalty]
#   - TP Hit:  +1.0 * (tp_mult/8.0)  [TP bonus]
#   - 2R+ trades: +2.0 bonus
#   - 1.5R+ trades: +1.0 bonus
#
# Loss Minimization:
#   - Large losses (-2R): -3.0 penalty
#   - Medium losses (-1R): -1.5 penalty
#   - Drawdown: -(dd² * 30.0)  [Reduced from 50.0]
#
# Growth Incentive:
#   - Equity growth: +0.1 * growth_pct (capped at 5.0)
