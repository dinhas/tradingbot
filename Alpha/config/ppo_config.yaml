# Learning Rate: Reduced to 5e-5 for very smooth, stable updates
learning_rate: 0.00005

# Rollout Settings: 
# Large n_steps and batch_size for high-quality gradient estimation

# PPO Clipping: Tightened to 0.1 for incremental policy shifts
clip_range: 0.1
clip_range_vf: null

# Entropy Regularization: Lowered to 0.01 to allow convergence while preventing premature stagnation

# Network Architecture
# Reverted to V1 Baseline [256, 256, 128]
# While inputs are fewer (40 vs 140), the 'Peek & Label' task (predicting 1000 steps ahead) 
# requires deep non-linearity. 2.5M data points support this capacity without overfitting.
