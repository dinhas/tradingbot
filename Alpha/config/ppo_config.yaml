# Temporal Discounting
# Reduced gamma to 0.95 to focus on the immediate "Peek & Label" trade outcome
# while still maintaining some horizon for drawdown avoidance.

# Network Architecture
# Reverted to V1 Baseline [256, 256, 128]
# While inputs are fewer (40 vs 140), the 'Peek & Label' task (predicting 1000 steps ahead) 
# requires deep non-linearity. 2.5M data points support this capacity without overfitting.
