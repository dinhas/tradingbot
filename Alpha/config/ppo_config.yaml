# SIMPLIFIED ALPHA CONFIG — Optimized for Directional Trading
# =========================================================================

# Learning Rate: Slightly higher for faster convergence on directional task
learning_rate: 0.0004

# Rollout Settings: Increased n_steps and batch_size for more stable gradients
# across multiple assets (since we now train on one pair at a time).
n_steps: 4096
batch_size: 512
n_epochs: 15

# Temporal Discounting
gamma: 0.99
gae_lambda: 0.95

# PPO Clipping
clip_range: 0.2

# Entropy Coefficient: Slightly higher to ensure thorough exploration of 
# Buy/Sell/Flat signals before convergence.
ent_coef: 0.015

# Loss Coefficients
vf_coef: 0.5

# Gradient Clipping
max_grad_norm: 0.5

# Training Budget: 2M steps for robust generalization across all 5 pairs
total_timesteps: 2000000

# Network Architecture: Lighter weight architecture (128, 128, 64) 
# appropriate for 40 features and a single output.
