# AI Trading Agent - Current Progress

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 17, 2025

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to build an autonomous, AI-powered scalping system that uses Google Gemini for trading decisions and executes trades via the cTrader Open API, as detailed in `projectreport.md`.

## 2. Current Status: Foundation Complete

The initial phase of development is complete. The legacy scripts have been successfully refactored into a robust, service-oriented architecture.

### Key Achievements:
- **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is now organized into distinct services (`services/`), utilities (`utils/`), and a central orchestrator (`main.py`).
- **Configuration:** All settings are managed externally in `config.json`.
- **cTrader Connection:** A stable, reusable `CTraderClient` handles the connection, authentication, and message dispatching with the cTrader API.
- **Event Loop:** The application is built correctly on the Twisted framework, resolving previous event loop conflicts.
- **Core Services:**
    - `MarketDataService`: Can successfully fetch the list of all available symbols.
    - `AIEngine`, `RiskManager`, `TradeExecutor`: Exist as well-defined placeholder services, ready for logic implementation.
- **Runnable Application:** The `main.py` script successfully starts, connects to cTrader, runs for 60 seconds, and shuts down cleanly.

**The project's foundational structure is now solid and ready for the implementation of core trading logic.**

## 3. Next Steps: Implementing Core Logic

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the features outlined in the `projectreport.md`. The recommended order of implementation is:

1.  **Real-Time Market Data:**
    *   Enhance `MarketDataService` to subscribe to live spot prices for configured currency pairs (e.g., EURUSD).
    *   Implement logic to construct 5-minute candles from the live tick data.

2.  **Technical Indicator Calculation:**
    *   Create a utility or service to calculate the required technical indicators (EMAs, RSI, Stochastics, etc.) on each 5-minute candle close using a library like `pandas-ta`.

3.  **AI Engine Integration:**
    *   Replace the placeholder `AIEngine` with the actual implementation.
    *   Integrate the Google Gemini API to get trading decisions based on the market data and indicators.

4.  **Risk Management:**
    *   Implement the validation rules in `RiskManager` (e.g., check max daily loss, position size, confidence score).

5.  **Trade Execution:**
    *   Implement the `TradeExecutor` to place market orders with stop loss and take profit levels via the cTrader API.

6.  **Position Monitoring:**
    *   Add logic to monitor open positions for breakeven adjustments, partial take-profits, and time-based exits.

7.  **Testing & Monitoring:**
    *   Develop unit tests for each service.
    *   Build the real-time monitoring dashboard.
